Snob was always a shy and odd piglet; he did not understand why the others were so determind to eat the curry with a fork instead of using their hoovs or hands. He also cudn’t grasp why the only solution was to go on a jurney to clone a fork. But he was too shy to say anything, and seeing the determinashun in the eyes of Bob, Mob, and Rob he knew that the piglets were going to suceed, so off he went with the rest. On the first day, Blob and Gog bumped into a ship capten who was initially angrie at their clumziness. But after apologizing profusely, they got to talking, and the capten—kind enuff at heart—allowed the piglet gang to join him on his voyage to the greatest city in the Milky Way: Computat-Sociali-Sci. A city so vast it spanned three planets in one system. Home to the greatest minds in the galaxy, it seemd like the perfect place to find someone to help solve their reposatory problems."

    return "Snob stormed off in anger. 'How do you confuse coffee with curry?' he muttured. In his angry march, he wanderred in front of a large building with many intricatt colums of marble. He realized at once that it was the library, full of dusty forks and forgotten commits. Rob, Bob, Blob, Mob, and Gog followed him inside, tripping over each other in the rush. Snob tried to shhh them, but Rob and Bob kept gossipping, Blob was hungry again, Mob wanted to open a new branch, and Gog whispered that this place looked like it had never passed a single unit test."

    return " Later that night, Rob, Bob, Snob, Blob, Mob, and Gog lay under the starrs, still giggling about the forks. Rob drew constellashuns in the air with his fork, Bob pretended to fork the moon, Snob critiqued their 'lack of elegence,' Blob munched grass noisily, Mob rolled around laffing, and Gog whispered: 'As long as we fork together, nothing can brake us.'
